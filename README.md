# 👋 Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Konstantinos, a researcher at the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://www.met.no/) and researcher/lecturer at the [IMT/NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/imt). With a background in Physics, Meteorology, and Oceanography, I am deeply involved in exploring and understanding the dynamics of ocean waves 🌊.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research spans various aspects of wave and ocean dynamics, with a focus on:

- **🌊 Metocean Statistics**
- **🌬️ Modelling of wind-generated waves**
- **🏞️ Fjord wave modelling and observations**
- **🌊 Wave-current interaction**
- **⚙️ Hydrodynamics**
- **🌍 Offshore wind energy**
- **🌊 Wave Energy**
- **🏖️ Coastal engineering**

I am passionate about improving our understanding of coastal and oceanic processes, particularly in the context of renewable energy. ♻️

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[DNORA](https://github.com/MET-OM/dnora)**: Open-source software for high-resolution coastal wave simulations.
- **[metocean-stats](https://github.com/MET-OM/metocean-stats)**: Open-source software for metocean statistics.
- **[metocean-api](https://github.com/MET-OM/metocean-api)**: Open-source software for extracting metocean data.
